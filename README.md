# Flood-it

This is an implementation of the game Flood-it, in which the player is presented
with a grid of colored squares, and they can change the color of the top-left
contiguous blob.  With each color change, the top-left blob "absorbs" adjacent
blobs of that color.  The objective is to fill the board with one color.
